# Handwritten-digit-Classification

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

## Project Structure

- `data`: Contains information on data acquisition.
- `models`: Stores the trained models.
- `notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks for various stages of the project.
- `scripts`: Python scripts for data processing, model building, training, evaluation, and visualization.
